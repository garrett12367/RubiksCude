# RubiksCude
Implementation of artificial intelligence search algorithms in order to solve a rubik's cube from an initial random state.

This project is very simple to run. Simply open the python script or Jupyter notebook and execute the program. There are no external libraries or tools that must be installed. This code contains less optimal hueristics and other solution depth initial states for reference but have been commented out.
